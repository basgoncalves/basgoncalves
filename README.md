- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @basgoncalves
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in biomedical sciences and 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning machine learning with Python 




I'm a biomechanist and data scientist with a background in human movement analysis, medical imaging, and musculoskeletal modelling.


My main skills include:
- Matlab, Python and R (for data analysis and processing)
- Basic machine learning with Python
- Basic Golang programming for app and software development
- Excellent scientific background in the fields of biomechanics and biomedical engineering

For the last 7 years I worked closely with stakeholders, clinicians, engineers, and computer scientists in product design, injury prevention, 
performance analysis, and improving orthopedic treatments.
My skills can help to bridge the gap between management, engineers, and clients who have very different expectations 
and require someone with intermediate knowledge to communicate effectively.
